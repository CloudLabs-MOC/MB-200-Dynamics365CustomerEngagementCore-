Module 0: Change log (for MCT use only)
=================================

## September 2020

Large-scale changes
--------

1. **New tenant solution**
As of September 14, 2020, our Power Platform and Dynamics 365 courses are supported by a new tenant solution. Instead of supplying a full Dynamics 365 tenant for Power Platform courses via the Authorized Lab Hoster, we will be supplying a Microsoft 365 (E5) tenant. Using the Microsoft 365 tenant, students can activate a Power Platform trial that will give them full organizational access to the Power Platform applications, including Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power Virtual Agents. The activation process for the new tenant type is outlined in a new Module 0 Lab 0 (titled **Validate Lab Environment**) and should only take a few minutes.

2. **New course outline**
The MB-200 course is becoming solution-agnostic. In an upcoming release, the course will switch from a Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement course to a Power Platform course. As a result, some topics are no longer included in the curriculum, and labs covering those topics are being removed. Other labs will be added according to the new curriculum. 
  The removal of these labs was also based on feedback that the amount of labs in the course sometimes caused timing issues.
