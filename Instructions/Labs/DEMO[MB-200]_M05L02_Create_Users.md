Module 5: Security
==================

## Lesson 2: Practice Lab – Create users

Scenario
--------

You are a functional consultant for your organization Contoso. You are assigned
to work on a project for your client Fabrikam. You will be continuing your work
on the model-driven Knowledge Admin app. In this practice, you will be creating
a dashboard and modifying the app to include it.

We need to add additional users to be able to use the application we have built.
You will be adding three users to the tenant; one manager and two additional
users. For this practice you will be adding them and assigning their licenses.
In future practices we will add security roles and organize the team members.
