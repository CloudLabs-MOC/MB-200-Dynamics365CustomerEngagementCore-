Module 3: Building Model-Driven Applications
============================================

## Lesson 4: Practice Lab – Modifying forms

Scenario
--------

You are a functional consultant for your organization Contoso. You are assigned
to work on a project for your client Fabrikam. In this practice you will be
continuing your work on the model-driven Knowledge Admin app. In this practice,
you will be modifying the auto generated forms to add the new fields you added
in the data-modeling practice.

**Important Note:** This lab will provide you with an actual Office 365 tenant
and licenses for the Power Platform applications you will be using in this
course. You will only be provided with one tenant for the practice labs in this
course. The settings and actions you take within this tenant do not roll-back or
reset, whereas the virtual machine you are provided with does reset each time
you close the lab session. Please be aware that Office 365 is evolving all the time. The
instructions in this document may be different from what you experience in your
actual Office 365 tenant. It is also possible to experience a delay of several
minutes before the virtual machine has network connectivity to begin the labs.

Exercise 1 - Acquire Tenant Information and Connect
---------------------------------------------------

**Note:** If you have already completed a practice recently, the virtual machine
might pick up where you left off and you will not need to login again.  In that
case you can skip ahead to exercise two and resume.

### Task 1 – Connect to the Power Platform administration portal

1.  On Virtual machine MB200-Dynamics_Lab, sign in as Admin with the password
    Pa55w.rd if you are not already logged in.

2.  Outside the VM in the online lab interface click Files and choose D365
    Credentials. This will allocate an Office 365 tenant for you to use in these
    labs.  It will display the admin email and password for your tenant.  You
    should copy this information to notepad or similar for your reference.

3.  In MB200-Dynamics_Lab launch Microsoft Edge from the taskbar. By default,
    the browser opens Office 365. Use the O365 credentials you just acquired in
    the previous step to login.

4.  Navigate in the browser to the Power Platform admin portal at
    [https://admin.Powerplatform.microsoft.com].

Exercise 2 – Edit the Knowledge Assessment Form 
------------------------------------------------

In this exercise, you will edit the form for the Knowledge Assessment entity.
There are two places you can edit this from, either from the Solutions > Entity > Forms list, or via the App Designer. If you are already in App
Designer start, there.

### Task 1 – Enable Notes on the Knowledge Assessment entity

Initially when the entity was created notes were not enabled. Since then the
client Fabrikam has determined that they like to be able to track notes against
the knowledge assessments. We are going to make this change before getting into
the form editor because it is the easier way to do so. The same is true, for
example, if you need to add any fields: you should always try to add the fields
before jumping into the editor.
