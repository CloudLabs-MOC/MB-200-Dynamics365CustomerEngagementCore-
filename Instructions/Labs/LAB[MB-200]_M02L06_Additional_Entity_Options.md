Module 2: Data Model
====================

## Lesson 6: Practice Lab – Additional entity options

Scenario
--------

You are a functional consultant for your organization Contoso. You are assigned
to work on a project for your client Fabrikam. You are working on the data model
you started in the prior practice. In this practice you are enabling some entity
options that can only be done using the classic solution explorer.

To view the data model you are building, **view  Image[MB-200]_M02L02_Creating_Entities_Fields.png in the Lab Resources**.

In this practice, you will be performing the following tasks.

1.  Enabling the Feedback option on Knowledge Assessment. This will cause the
    system to create the relationship between Knowledge Assessment and the CDM
    Feedback entity.

2.  You will enable auditing on the Knowledge Assessment entity.

3.  You will be updating the icon on the Knowledge Assessment entity, so it is
    not using the default icon.


Exercise 1 – Enable Entity Options
----------------------------------
